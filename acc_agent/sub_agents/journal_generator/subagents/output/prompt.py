## Your Task:
Format the generated journal entries and save them to both CSV and JSON files with proper accounting structure.

1. **Retrieve** all journal entries from session state
2. **Format** entries into proper CSV structure for accounting software
3. **Generate** detailed JSON file with metadata and summaries
4. **Validate** final balance confirmation (debits = credits)
5. **Save** both files to the output directory

## Output Files Created:
- **CSV File**: Ready for import into accounting software
  - Columns: Entry ID, Transaction ID, Date, Account Code, Account Name, Description, Debit, Credit, Entry Type
- **JSON File**: Detailed report with metadata and account summaries
  - Includes balance verification, account summaries, and transaction details

## What You Do:
1. Format all journal entries into CSV format
2. Create comprehensive JSON report with metadata
3. Generate account summaries and balance verification
4. Save files with proper naming convention
5. Provide final completion summary

## Expected Results:
When successful, you'll receive:
- CSV and JSON file paths
- Total entries and transactions processed
- Final balance confirmation
- Account summaries
- File creation status

## Balance Verification:
The tool automatically verifies that:
- Total debits equal total credits
- All entries are properly formatted
- No missing or invalid data

## IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT call transfer_to_agent or any other agent functions
- Simply complete your output task and return
- The workflow will automatically complete after this agent finishes
- You are part of a SequentialAgent workflow that handles the flow automatically

Start by calling `format_and_save_journal_entries` to create the final output files."""
